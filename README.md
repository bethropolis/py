```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/Scripts/activate  # On Linux, use `venv/bin/activate`
```

3. Install project dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration

1. Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`.

2. Edit the `.env` file with your MySQL database configuration:

DB_PASSWORD=db_password
DB_HOST=db_host
DB_PORT=3306
```
